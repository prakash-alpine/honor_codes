# HonorCodes

Generate honor code style licences.

The 'license' is entirely reversible and is not intended to protect from malicious use, but provides a nice generator
and interpreter for creating non-directly editable licences or config files.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'honor_codes'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:
